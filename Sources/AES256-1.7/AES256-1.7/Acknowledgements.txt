The most basic part of the package, the encryption and decryption
of 16 byte blocks is based on the C implementation of AES-256 by
Ilya O. Levin and Hal Finney, which can be downloaded from

   http://www.literatecode.com/aes256

Test suites used for basic validation are supplied by NIST (National
Institute of Standards and Technology) and can be downloaded from

"Dinghao" was so kind to let me know about a bug in the stringifi-
cation of 'Byte_Block' objects when PKCS5/PKCS7 padding is used
and supplied a patch.
